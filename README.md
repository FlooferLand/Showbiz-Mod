A fan-made Minecraft mod focused around [The Rockafire Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SeSavNd9_c&list=PLB8A625C54121DA04)

Minecraft lets you combine tons of different mods and situations, making this simulator able to be enjoyed in VR via mods like ViveCraft, and with friends via multiplayer.

Unlike a proper simulation engine, this mod is pretty simple by design.
